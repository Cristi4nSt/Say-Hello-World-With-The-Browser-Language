# About this project
A website that displays a "Hello World" depending on the user's browser language. It was inspired by Florin Pop's Github, in the repository "app-ideas"           
https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Hello-App.md


# Obs
As it is a site I made for fun and study, all translations into other languages were done with the help of Google Translate.
